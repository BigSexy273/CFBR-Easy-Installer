### - These instructions are only for users who purchased a DIGITAL copy of NCAA Football 14 (game ID NPUB31137) on the PSN Store. 
### - DO NOT USE THESE INSTRUCTIONS IF YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL COPY OF THE GAME. IF YOU ARE UNSURE, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY USE THE DISC INSTALLER [HERE](https://github.com/cfbrevamped/CFBR-Easy-Installer/blob/master/PS3/disc.md).

### Prerequisites:
- PS3 console (any model)
- USB drive (8 GB or larger)
- Some kind of computer (any Windows PC, Mac, or even Chromebook will work)
- Either a phsical game disc or a copy of the game files

Everything here is only needed for first time setup, aside from the console itself of course.

## PS3 (PSN Store Digital Copy) Download Instructions:
1) Follow [this great YouTube guide to install HEN and Multiman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOKemRHAZ3c) on your PS3. It should only take 30 minutes to an hour. **YOU CAN SKIP THE OPTIONAL STEP from 13:17-14:29**.
2) Make sure your game is downloaded to your console as it would be normally if you wanted to play it.
3) Move over to your computer and download the following files:
- [**PART A (~3GB)**](https://bit.ly/2REm3Ob)
- [**PART B (~1GB)**](https://bit.ly/33FSTUq)
  
If you receive a message that too many users have viewed or downloaded this file recently, please use the following links:
  - [**PART A (~3GB)**](https://bit.ly/32KrfpZ)
  - [**PART B (~1GB)**](https://bit.ly/33IAIgF)

4) Drag and drop both files onto the root of your USB drive (this means they should not be inside any folder)
5) Plug your USB drive into your PS3, navigate to the game tab on the main menu and click the "Enable Hen" button. If it fails, just try again until it works. Then scroll down to the bottom and open the "Package Manager". Then click "Install Package Files". Then click "Standard". You should now see files called `CFBR PS3 Easy Installer V3 Part A.pkg` and `CFBR PS3 Easy Installer V3 Part B.pkg`. Select Part A and wait for it to finish installing, then select Part B and wait for that to finish installing. Please note, Part A will take longer than Part B.
6) Once both parts are finished installing, you can remove the USB drive. You should now see a CFBR logo instead of the typical NCAA 14 icon. Launch the game like normal and enjoy the mods!
