## Known Mod Issues:
- **Pink cleats for Charlotte, Coastal Carolina, App State, Georgia Southern, and Pitt in uniform select:** This is glitch with the original game that we cannot fix. The issue will only show during uniform select. All team colors will properly show in game. 
- **Dynasty Crashing:** The v4 release should eliminate all dynasty freezing caused by the mod in prior versions. If you experience freezing, please let us know.
- **Darker Leg Skin Color:** Some skintones have a darker leg color. This will be fixed in v5.
