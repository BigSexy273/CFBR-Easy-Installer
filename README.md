## You <ins>DO NOT</ins> need any prior versions of the Easy Installer or any other mods installed before using V4 of the Easy Installer.
## This mod <ins>INCLUDES ALL PRIOR VERSIONS</ins> and will overwrite any previously installed mods. YOU DO NOT NEED TO DELETE V3 OR ANY PRIOR VERSIONS.

---------

## Known Mod Issues:
- **Dynasty Crashing:** We are aware of users experiencing occassional crashes during dynasty games. The v4 release should significantly reduce, if not eliminate the frequency of crashes, however **we still advise that you skip all cutscenes, especially the pregame introduction, studio updates, the halftime show, and postgame.**
- **Pink cleats for Charlotte, Coastal Carolina, App State, Georgia Southern, and Pitt in uniform select:** This will only show during uniform select. All team colors will properly show in game. A fix will be released in v5.
