## You <ins>DO NOT</ins> need any prior versions of the Easy Installer or any other mods installed before using V3 of the Easy Installer.
## This mod <ins>INCLUDES ALL PRIOR VERSIONS</ins> and will overwrite any previously installed mods. YOU DO NOT NEED TO DELETE V2 OR ANY PRIOR VERSIONS.

---------

## Known Mod Issues:
- **Dynasty Crashing:** We are aware of users experiencing occassional crashes during dynasty games. We are currently investigating the root cause and hope to provide a fix in the near future. **Until a fix is released, we advise that you skip all cutscenes, especially the pregame introduction, studio updates, the halftime show, and postgame.**
- **Syracuse Orange Helmet:** The Syracuse orange helmet has a gray facemask (should be navy). This will be fixed in a future release.
- **Boston College:** BC recently revealed new uniforms, which we were unable to include in this release due to time. They will be added in the v4 release.
- **Georgia, Pitt, and other recent uniform reveals:** We are working to the create new/updated uniforms as quickly as we can. We plan on adding as many as we can in the v4 release.
